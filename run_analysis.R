##  NOTE TO GRADER
##  I PREFERED TO WORK FROM EVERYTHING BEING UNZIPPED FROM THE PROVIDED DATA, AND USE THE WORKING DIRECTORY ABOVE THAT
##  THIS IS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE THE FILES AROUND FROM THE DATA WE WERE GIVEN - SEEMED TO BREAK THE CONCEPT
##  OF REPEATABILITY (I.E. SOMEONE ELSE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE THE DATA FILES AROUND TOO)
##  SO THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF THE SAMSUNG DATA IS UNZIPPED INTO YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY
